Starcode is tested on Linux and Mac. It has not been tested on Windows.
Compile the usual way with `make` on Linux.

make
./starcode test_file.txt

On Mac, the above will work in the terminal if xcode is installed
(available from the Mac appstore). Compilation will produce a bunch
of warnings, but running the example above should work.
